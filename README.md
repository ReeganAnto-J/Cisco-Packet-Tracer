# Packet Tracer Projects

This is a collection of all the packet tracer projects I will be doing

My plan is to take a specific situation and some specific requirements and design a network as per the needs

I will try to practically apply new things as I learn

## Projects:

### Kolkata Call Centre (Project 1):
This project recreates the setup used by call centre scammers in Kolkata taken from a CCTV image, the recreation was done from visual understanding from the image and I cannot guarentee its accuracy.

### Startup Home Network (Project 2):
This is a scenario which I created in which a group of 9 friends are making their own startup and the System Administrator is designated to build a small network in order to manage their small team's networking needs.
